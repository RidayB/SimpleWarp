# SimpleWarp

This is a simple warp plugin I spent a day making. The raw version of this ReadMe is formatted better so you may want to use that instead.

This plugin has two levels of warps, public warps and private warps. These have specified permissions to access each of them. 

This plugin also has signs which can be used to warp, there is a permission to go with this. 
To format the sign, let's say our warp was called examplewarp. On the topline it would say "SimpleWarpTP", and on the bottom line it would say "examplewarp". This is how it looks.
